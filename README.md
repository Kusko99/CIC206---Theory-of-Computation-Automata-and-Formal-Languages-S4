# Theory-of-Computation-Automata-and-Formal-Languages Project: AFD Simulator

Greetings! This repository houses a project developed during the "Theory of Computation, Automata, and Formal Languages" course, led by Professor Marco Antonio Furlan.

## About the Project

This repository features a Python-based simulator for Deterministic Finite Automata (AFDs). The project was a practical application of the theoretical concepts covered in the "Theory-of-Computation-Automata-and-Formal-Languages" course, where Professor Marco Antonio Furlan guided students through the exploration of theoretical computer science concepts.

## Features

- **AFD Simulator:** Python implementation of a simulator for Deterministic Finite Automata.
- **Course Concepts:** Practical application of theoretical concepts learned during the course.
- **Professor's Guidance:** The project reflects the guidance and teachings of Professor Marco Antonio Furlan.

## How to Use This Repository

Explore the code to understand the implementation of the AFD simulator. This project serves as a practical illustration of the theoretical principles covered in the "Theory of Computation, Automata, and Formal Languages" course.
